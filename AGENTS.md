# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds TypeScript source for circular progress components (`circularProgress`, `circularProgressBase`, `components`, `hooks`, `utils`, `types`) exported through `src/index.ts`.
- `examples/` contains showcase assets and GIFs; treat as reference for usage patterns.
- `lib/` is generated by `react-native-builder-bob`; avoid manual edits.
- Config roots: linting (`.eslintrc`, `.eslintignore`), builds (`babel.config.js`, `tsconfig*.json`), tests (`jest.setup.js`). Husky hooks live in `.husky/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `yarn lint` / `yarn lint:fix` - run ESLint with Prettier rules, optionally autofixable items.
- `yarn tsc` - type-checks against `tsconfig.build.json`.
- `yarn test` - executes Jest with the React Native preset; uses `jest.setup.js`.
- `yarn build` - builds CommonJS, ES modules, and type defs via Bob into `lib/`.
- `yarn ci` - shortcut for `lint` + `tsc`; executed by `.husky/pre-commit`.
- `yarn prepare` - builds and installs Husky hooks; runs automatically after install.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript preferred; use `.tsx` for React components. Two-space indentation, single quotes, semicolons, and line length <=95 enforced by ESLint/Prettier.
- Keep imports ordered with blank lines between groups; avoid unused imports/vars.
- Components/functions in PascalCase; hooks start with `use`; props/state/locals camelCase; constants SCREAMING_SNAKE only when necessary.
- Favor destructuring and `curly` braces; avoid nested ternaries and inline styles unless necessary.

## Testing Guidelines
- Jest + `@testing-library/react-native` available; place specs near code in `__tests__` folders (e.g., `src/circularProgress/__tests__/circularProgress.test.tsx`).
- Mock Reanimated/SVG as needed per `jest.setup.js`; exclude generated `lib/`.
- For new features, cover happy/edge paths; use deterministic timers and avoid animation timing flakiness.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history uses Conventional-style prefixes (`docs:`, `chore:`, etc.); keep concise, imperative subjects.
- Before opening a PR, ensure `yarn ci` and relevant tests pass; note if coverage is limited.
- PR description should explain intent, list changes, and link issues. Include before/after screenshots or updated GIFs for visual tweaks or `examples/` updates.
- Call out breaking or behavioral changes in the PR body and changelog when applicable.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Verify peer deps (`react-native-reanimated` >=2.2, `react-native-svg` >=12.1.1, `react-native-redash` >=15.0.1) remain compatible; do not commit secrets.
- When adjusting build output, regenerate via `yarn build` rather than editing `lib/` directly.
